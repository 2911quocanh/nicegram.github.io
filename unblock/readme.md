You can access some unavailable chats in Nicegram.  
Due to [AppStore Rules](https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/#user-generated-content), you must enable this setting outside of the Nicegram app.  

There are multiple ways to do it.

This works only for **Nicegram 5.11 (59)** and later!

### P. S.

1) In case you're using multiple accounts, you should enable this option for each account.

2) Previous "Nicegram Debug" option is not used now. You don't need to tap fast on settings icon. App automatically sync your settings on start.

3) Some chats may be blocked globally by Telegram - there's no way to unblock them.

4) Also, users from China, India, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and others can face **Region Block**. To access such chats, you need to create account with sim-card from another region. For example, can use sms/voip numbers. Just [Google it](https://www.google.com/search?q=voip+number+for+telegram).

5) If you're an owner of such chat/bot/channel, contact Telegram support. Nicegram can't help you.  

### P. P. S.

Some chats may be inaccessible even in Nicegram due to [AppStore Rules](https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/#user-generated-content)
