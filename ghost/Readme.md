# Ghost Mode in Nicegram

### How it works?
When you enable Ghost Mode, app sets your «Last Seen» privacy setting to "Nobody". 

After that, application enables «Chats Preview mode». It's global setting for entire app. 
Last seen privacy changes only for current selected account.
You need to "re-enable" it after you switch to other account.

In preview mode you can enter any chat, but Nicegram will not send read mark to the recipient.
In Official Telegram app - You can also preview chats with long-tap (force touch). Read marks will not be send too!

If you send or type **ANY** message to **ANYBODY**, your online status may be revealed. That's how Telegram «Last Seen» privacy settings work!

Ghost Mode feature is just a shortcut for Official Telegram actions.

### Does it violate Telegram TOS?
1) Last Seen setting setup is done with Telegram.
2) Chat Preview without «read marks» available in official app.

### But what about Telegram TOS p. 1.4? 
**«It is forbidden to tampering with the ’read‘ statuses of messages (implementing a ’ghost mode')»**

So Official Telegram app violates it's own rules? Let's report @Telegram then.

### Approved (available in stores) applications with Ghost Mode
- Telegram X (Android)
- BGram (Android)
- ...

### Conclusion
Ghost Mode is not a violation of Telegram TOS, until you can do same in official app.




##### P.S. It's still an experimental feature and everything may change, you know.
