# Translate Nicegram
Nicegram wants to deliver best experience for every user in every language.

Nicegram invites everyone to Translate, Spellcheck and Suggest new translations or languages!

## Translate App

Please, Try to look at [official translations](https://translations.telegram.org/en/ios/) if you need an inspiration.

Discuss translations in chat if you're not sure.

Ping [@Kylmakalle](https://t.me/Kylmakalle) if you've done a new translation, so it will be added in the app.

## Translate Articles

It's hard to control translations via [telegra.ph](https://telegra.ph) or other platforms.

Steps to translate:
1) Create new `<lang>` folder with `readme.md` for in `<article>` folder. Translation will be available at [nicegram.app/\<article\>/](https://nicegram.app/article)`<lang>`

2) If you're translating images too, create folder `images` inside. If not, you can reference original (english) images with string like `../images/banner.png`

3) **Recommendation:** Try to use local `images` folder instead of link to images, because some hostings can be blocked in your country.

5) Add links to [main page](https://github.com/nicegram/nicegram.github.io/blob/master/README.md) if you've done a new translation.

6) Submit a pull-request and ping [@Kylmakalle](https://t.me/Kylmakalle)

Please, do not translate `chats` section.

You can use [this folder](https://github.com/nicegram/nicegram.github.io/tree/master/faq) as example.


Thank you in advance!
