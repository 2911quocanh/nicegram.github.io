# Nicegram 7.0

It was a long time between Nicegram updates. A lot of things changed and a lot of feaures was implemented in official Telegram app.
I also assume lots of users switched to official app as well. But finally, here's something you can hear from Nicegram.

First of all, this update is based on latest TG sources, which is version 7.0.1.

Due to this long suspension of Nicegram development, I've decided that it's became too hard to support current app code and it needs to be rewritten, so some features will be re-implemented slowly.

# Unique Nicegram features 7.0

- [Chats & Messages unblock method](/unblock)
- Forward As Copy (without Author)
- Save to Cloud button for fast forwarding to your saved messages.
- Messages translator via GTranslate
- [Premium] Quick Translate button
- Ability to hide contacts tab & tab names
- Fixed theming for alternative tabs

_Other Features are not re-implemented yet ðŸ˜©_

# Telegram implemented Nicegram's features

I mostly prefer official solution due to sync and support. Legacy Nicegram features will not overwrite existing functionality in future.

### Folders, Filters & Unlimited Pins
Now we have official and synced TG folders. You're welcome to use them. 
Unfortunatelly, there's no method to export NG folders to TG, you need to do that manually (or you've already done that).

Nicegram also implements alternative design and position for folders list.

You can setup up to 10 folders with different filters and pin up to 100 chats in each folder. If it's not enough, you might register one more TG account.

# Premium
Let's be honest, Nicegram is not a business and I assume that Premium is kind of a donaton option to support and run Nicegram servers and it's development, so there're some fair rules:

- **$0.99** for new users, until some more features coming soon.
- **Free** for already premium users (Tap "Restore purchases")


**Features:**
- Quick Translate button
- More Coming Soon...

# Community
It would be bad to not mention all the generous comunity members that help, translate, support and spread Nicegram and everything about it.

Special thanks to @xXMeliodas [for donating Apple Watch](https://t.me/nicegramdev/97) so I'm able to include AW app in Nicegram.
